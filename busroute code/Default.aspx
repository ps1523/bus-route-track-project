        QR Code and Website Bus Route tracking Information system</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The &quot;<b>QR Code and Website using Bus Route Tracking Information System</b>&quot; is a forward-thinking web application project designed to modernize and enhance the public bus transport experience. Developed using ASP.Net for the front end and SQL Server for the back end, this system is specifically tailored to cater to the needs of an efficient bus information system. It aims to provide detailed and easily accessible information about point-to-point bus routes, particularly those traveling across districts, thereby revolutionizing the way passengers interact with public transport services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The current landscape of public bus transportation is plagued with challenges regarding the dissemination of timely and accurate route information. Passengers often find themselves in the dark about bus availability, schedules, and fare details, particularly for inter-district services. The lack of an integrated digital solution to provide real-time updates and route-specific information leads to confusion, delays, and a generally inefficient system. This not only affects passenger satisfaction but also impedes the overall functionality of the public transportation system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <img alt="img3" class="auto-style2" src="images/img3.jpg" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">To address these challenges, the proposed system introduces a seamless integration of QR code technology and a dedicated web application. Users can simply input a bus number or scan a QR code to access a wealth of information including bus stoppings, timings, and fare charges for their specific route. This system is designed to be user-friendly, catering to both regular commuters and new passengers. It ensures that vital information about bus routes is easily accessible and comprehensible, thus simplifying the process of using public transport for inter-district travel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The implementation of this QR code and web-based tracking system is expected to bring a transformative change to public bus transportation. It will significantly enhance the passenger experience by providing reliable and real-time information, thereby reducing wait times and uncertainty associated with public transport. The system is set to improve operational efficiency, promote better resource management for transport providers, and potentially increase the usage of public transport. In the long run, this could lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and environmental impact, promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach to urban transportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
